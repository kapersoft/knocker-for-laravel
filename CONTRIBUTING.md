## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment. By participating, you are expected to uphold this standard. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP 8.3 or higher**
- **Composer** (latest version)
- **Git**
- A **Laravel application** for testing (Laravel 12.0+)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kapersoft/knocker-for-laravel.git
   cd knocker-for-laravel
   ```

## Development Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### Development Tools

This project uses several development tools that are automatically configured:

- **Pest** - Testing framework
- **PHPStan** - Static analysis
- **Laravel Pint** - Code formatting
- **Rector** - Code refactoring and modernization

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test-coverage

# Run static analysis
composer analyse

# Format code
composer format

# Prepare package for development
composer prepare
```

## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow **PSR-12** coding standards
- Use **strict types** declarations in all PHP files
- Write **type hints** for all method parameters and return types
- Use **meaningful variable and method names**

### Code Formatting

Code formatting is handled automatically by Laravel Pint. Run the formatter before committing:

```bash
composer format
```

### Static Analysis

All code must pass PHPStan analysis at the highest level. Run static analysis with:

```bash
composer analyse
```

### Architecture Guidelines

- Follow **SOLID principles**
- Use **dependency injection** where appropriate
- Keep classes **focused and single-purpose**
- Write **self-documenting code** with clear method names
- Add **PHPDoc blocks** for complex methods

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Use **Pest** testing framework
- Follow the **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Write both **unit tests** and **integration tests** where appropriate

### Test Structure

```php
<?php

use Kapersoft\Knocker\YourClass;

it('can perform the expected action', function () {
    // Arrange
    $instance = new YourClass();

    // Act
    $result = $instance->performAction();

    // Assert
    expect($result)->toBe('expected_value');
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage report
composer test-coverage

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/pest tests/YourTestFile.php
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for **high test coverage** (90%+)
- All public methods should be tested
- Test both **happy paths** and **error conditions**

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Run the full test suite**:

   ```bash
   composer test
   composer analyse
   composer format
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if necessary

5. **Add or update tests** for your changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Clear title and description** - Explain what your PR does and why
2. **Reference related issues** - Use "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123"
3. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per PR
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add your changes under "Unreleased"
5. **Ensure CI passes** - All GitHub Actions must be green
